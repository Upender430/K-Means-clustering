# K-Means Clustering: Learning from Unlabeled Data

**Topic**: K-Means Clustering – Unsupervised Learning  
**Author**: Upendra Madha

---

## Overview

This project provides a step-by-step tutorial on **K-Means Clustering**, one of the most widely used unsupervised learning algorithms. The focus is on how the algorithm groups similar data points based on feature similarity, and how different values of `k` affect the results.

## Files Included

- `kmeans_tutorial.ipynb` – Code to implement K-Means using scikit-learn
- `kmeans_tutorial.pdf` – The written tutorial
- Plots showing clusters, centroids, and elbow method for optimal `k`

---

## Key Topics Covered

- What is K-Means?
- The role of centroids
- Choosing `k` (Elbow method)
- Visualizing clusters
- Using the Iris or synthetic dataset

---

## Getting Started

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Then open the notebook and follow along!
